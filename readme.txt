This readme.txt provides the necessary information to run the code program inside of this repository.

This program code is the same code with that we obtained the results (in 1d dynamics) in the paper titled "Collective learning from individual experiences and information transfer during group foraging" written by Andrea Falcón-Cortés, Denis Boyer and Gabriel Ramos-Fernández and sended to Journal of the Royal Society Interface, for the first time, at 26/10/2018. All the code was written by Andrea Falcón-Cortés. Especial acknowledges to A. Aldana for fruitful discussions. 

--- Necessary software ---

(1) JDK 1.8
(2) NetBeens IDE 8.2

--- In repository ---

In this repository besides this readme.txt there are eight java class with extension .java. Each one are necessary to run the main class RedCaminanteMain.java. 

--- Step by step ---

(1) In NetBeens interface go to File -> New Project. Select the options Java and Java Applications. The application name has to be ColLen1D.
(2) In the application ColLen1D pick the option Source Packages -> Java Package. The package name has to be collen1d.
(3) In the package  pick the option Java Class. The new java class name has to be te same that the choosen file (v.g.r. if you want to do the class RedCaminante, the name of the new class in the package collen1d has to be RedCaminante). Copy and paste the body of the choosen class and libraries in it. Do this for each class and run the main class RedCaminanteMain.
